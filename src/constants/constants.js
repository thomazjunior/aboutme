This allowed me to create a fast and responsive website that provides a smooth user experience. I also used Material-UI, a popular React UI framework, to design the website's interface. For the website's content management system (CMS), I used Sanity, a headless CMS that offers great flexibility and scalability. This allowed the client to easily manage their product inventory, pricing, and other content.",
